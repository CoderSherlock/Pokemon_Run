# Motivation
1. I just wanna say that I hate my professor.
2. I can't play Pokemon Go anymore.
3. Friends ask me to hang out and battle for gym.
4. Old friends want to play it in China.

# Current problem

1. I really don't have much time on this.
2. Niantic modified API and it still not be hacked right now.
